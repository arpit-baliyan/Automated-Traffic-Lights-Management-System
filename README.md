# Automated-Traffic-Lights-Management-System
This project implements an intelligent traffic management system that uses real-time data to dynamically control traffic lights. Unlike traditional fixed-time signals, this system employs sensors and computer vision to measure vehicle density on each road and optimize the green light duration. The primary goal is to reduce traffic congestion, minimize travel time, and improve overall intersection efficiency. 


## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



2. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
